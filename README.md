# FlightSurety

Hey there reviewer. This is my submission for the flight surety project.

## Libraries used
For the smart contracts:
* `truffle-test-utils`: used this library to simplify testing event emissions
* `truffle-assertions`: handy testing library

For the frontend:
* `webpack`: I preferred using webpack since it's more powerful that lite-server

## Version numbers

* Program: `1.0.0`
* node: `v16.5.0`
* Truffle: `v5.4.6`
* web3: `^1.2.4`
